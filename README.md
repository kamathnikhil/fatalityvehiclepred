Road accidents are very critical and a major problem in todays world. WHO (World Health Organization) had recorded around 1.25 million death in USA alone by motor vehicle. It is necessary to understand the severity of the crashes and anlayze the factors affecting it.This will help us to prevent some crashes in future. Can machine learning help us to predict factors affecting these crashes?

I have taken crash datset of New Zealand from crash analysis system which is easily available in different format and APIs. It has various different variables to consider: Traffic data Vehicle data Road data Crash data Weather data

I have used Geojson file, instead of the usual CSV file, so that we can perform geographic data analysis without creating geometries from latitude and longitude and deal with coordinate reference systems and projections.

In New Zealand, the total death in car crash accidents since the year 2000, up to 2018 is 6991. While the total number of serious injuries and minor injuries in car accidents reach 45604, 208623 respectively.

Fatality count is not very high in the data. Mostly consist of major and minor serious injusries.
